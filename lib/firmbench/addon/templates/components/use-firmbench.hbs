            actually performed by the office and equal to gross billings less pass-throughs
            and reimbursables) increased by more than $10,000 in the period from 2013
            to 2015. In fact, the average of $108,000 in net billings generated per
            employee in 2015 is even higher than it was during the pre-downturn peak
            in 2008. This shows an increase in firm efficiency, which contributes to
            firm stability. .</p>

          <p>The general upward trend of profits as the industry has been recovering
            from the economic downturn is clear: More than one in five firms was very
            profitable in 2015, and more importantly, the percentage reporting a loss
            declined sharply in recent years from more than 20% in 2011 to fewer than
            10% by 2015. As firms have returned to profitability, firm owners have
            been better able to reinvest in their businesses, with a focus on adding
            services, improving staff productivity, and rebuilding firm culture. After
            falling during the Great Recession, average firm profits as a share of
            net billings averaged more than 13% by 2015. More detail and information

          <p>On average, architecture firms derive a larger share of their firm billings
            from repeat clients (72%) than from new clients (28%). That share is even
            higher for nonresidential firms, which reported that an average of nearly
            three-quarters of their 2015 billings were from repeat clients, in contrast
            to firms with a residential specialization, which reported that 59% of
            their billings were derived from repeat clients. This is important because
            firms that foster and maintain client relationships tend to be more prosperous.
